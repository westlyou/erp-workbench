# DOCKER_DEFAULTS provides the information needed to work with docker

# Variables that can be used in the values
# %(BASE_PATH)s will be replaced with the actual folder where erp-worbnch is installed
# %(USER_HOME)s the home folder of the logged in user

DOCKER_DEFAULTS:

    # what is the name of the dockerhub to use

    # docker_port:
    # this is the default posrt we assign to a docker container to use
    # it has to be adapted in the site description depending on what
    # server the site is running

    # dumper_image:
    # when dumping a container based erp site site to its backup structure
    # a docker container is used that has access to databse container
    # where the sites data is maintained (normally this continer is named db)
    # to create a this dumper container we need an image which uses pgdump
    # to dump the db.
    # since pgdump is database version dependent, the database container
    # and the dumper container need to use the same pgdump version.
